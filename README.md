# Blindfold-Platformer

*Game entry for Ludum Dare 46*

**Theme: Keep It Alive**

## Idea

To make a platformer where the player has to save a character from falling to their death

## Story

The main character to be saved is actually a kid who just got his new VR headsets and is playing a VR game. Unbeknowst to him, he has actually left his room and headed outside while playing the game. So technically he is blind now and cant hear anything because his headphones have 100% noise cancelation. You are his best friend and your job is to save this guy from dying.
